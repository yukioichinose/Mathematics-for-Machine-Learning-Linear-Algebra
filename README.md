# Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning-Linear-Algebra
This is a repository that saves programming assignments created for [a Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/home/info) by Imperial College London. I take this course because I am interested in applying to graduate program in Computer Science. I would like to know a basic knowledge on Linear Algebra. 

## About the course
> In this course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to vectors and matrices. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them, including the knotty problem of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and how to use these to solve problems.
> Finally  we look at how to use these to do fun things with datasets - like how to rotate images of faces and how to extract eigenvectors to look at how the Pagerank algorithm works.
> Since we're aiming at data-driven applications, we'll be implementing some of these ideas in code, not just on pencil and paper. Towards the end of the course, you'll write code blocks and encounter Jupyter notebooks in Python, but don't worry, these will be quite short, focussed on the concepts, and will guide you through if you’ve not coded before.

> At the end of this course you will have an intuitive understanding of vectors and matrices that will help you bridge the gap into linear algebra problems, and how to apply these concepts to machine learning.

## Assignments
1. [IdentifyingSpecialMatrices](https://github.com/yukioichinose/Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning-Linear-Algebra/blob/main/IdentifyingSpecialMatrices.ipynb) - This is the first programming assignment for this course. In this assignment, you are required to write a function that will test if 4x4 matrix is singular to determine if an inverse matrix exists before calculating it. In this assignment, you convert a matrix into echelon form and test if this fails by leaving zeros tthat can't be removed on the leading diagonal.

## Quiz
This section has some useful hints for Quizes. 
- Using non-square matrices to do a projection: These images ([1](https://github.com/yukioichinose/Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning-Linear-Algebra/blob/main/Hint(Using%20non-square%20matrices%20to%20do%20a%20projection)_1.jpg) & [2](https://github.com/yukioichinose/Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning-Linear-Algebra/blob/main/Hint(Using%20non-square%20matrices%20to%20do%20a%20projection)_2.jpg)) posted in the discussion forum were helpful.

## Useful links
*This list contains links that I used for facilitating my understanding of vectors. Since I am a native Japanese speaker, most of the links in this list are based on Japanese. (It gives me better understanding of the contents)

1. [【大学数学】線形代数入門①(概観&ベクトル)【線形代数】 (Intro to Linear Algebra)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svm8hlhF8PA) - This YouTube channel provides cram school like lecture on a mathematical topic. Takumi does a excellent job at explaining Linear Algebra by calculating slowly and proving equations.
2. [Einstein Summation Convention: an Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLrTj7D2fLM) - This helped me understand Einstein Summation Convention, which was introduced in Week 4 of this course.
3. [行列の積(掛け算)とは何か？計算方法と意味が圧倒的によくわかる解説](https://www.headboost.jp/what-is-matrix-multiplication/) - This webpage (Japanese) illustrates how matrix transform vectors with animation. 
4. [Einsten summation, notes on matrix multiplication and symmetry of the dot product
](https://github.com/Renatochaz/Mathematics_for_Machine_Learning/blob/master/Week4.ipynb) - This github page helped me solve the week 4's quiz, [Example: Using non-square matrices to do a projection](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/quiz/GYaMz/example-using-non-square-matrices-to-do-a-projection). This quiz required a comprehensive knowledge of things I learned throughout the course. Also, it seems that other students who took this course strggled with this quiz.
