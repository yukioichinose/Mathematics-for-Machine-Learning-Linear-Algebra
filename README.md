# Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning-Linear-Algebra

## General
This is a repository that saves programming assignments created for a Coursera course by Imperial College London. I take this course because I am interested in applying to graduate program in Computer Science. I would like to know a basic knowledge on Linear Algebra. 

## About the notebooks
1. [IdentifyingSpecialMatrices](https://github.com/yukioichinose/Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning-Linear-Algebra/blob/main/IdentifyingSpecialMatrices.ipynb) - This is the first programming assignment for this course. In this assignment, you are required to write a function that will test if 4x4 matrix is singular to determine if an inverse matrix exists before calculating it. In this assignment, you convert a matrix into echelon form and test if this fails by leaving zeros tthat can't be removed on the leading diagonal.

*This list contains links that I used for facilitating my understanding of vectors. Since I am a native Japanese speaker, most of the links in this list are based on Japanese. (It gives me better understanding of the contents)
